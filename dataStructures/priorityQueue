PriorityQueue:
 when elements are processed based on the priority.
 i/p:
 [array of characters]- w,y,a,d,q-->a,d,q,w,y
 priority based on ASCII values.
Application:
 Dijkstra's Algorithm
 USE: always give smallest element when we poll.
 i/p:
 4 1 8 3 5 6
 store as 1.....(first elt is alwys smallest..remaining elements in any order)
poll()-1(o/p) [3,4,8,5,6] (remaining)
poll()-3      [4,8,5,6] (remaining)
poll()-4      [5,8,6] (remaining)
poll()-5      [6,8] (remaining)
