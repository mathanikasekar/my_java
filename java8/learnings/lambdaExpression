LAMBDAEXPRESSION:
 It provide the implementation of an interface which has functional interface
 we don't need to define the method again for providing the implementation.
 Java lambda expression is treated as a function, so compiler does not create .class file.

FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE:
 Lambda expression provides implementation of functional interface.
 An interface which has only one abstract method is called functional interface.
 Java provides an anotation @FunctionalInterface, which is used to declare an interface as functional

USE:
To provide the implementation of Functional interface.
Less coding.

SYNTAX:
 (argument-list) -> {body}
