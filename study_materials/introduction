JAVA
 -James Gosling in 1995
 -sun microsystems
 -high level language
 -object oriented language
 -Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in January, 2010.
 - Java is now maintained and distributed by Oracle.
 -File extensions: .JAVA, .JAV, .JAD, .JAR, .JSP, .CLASS

features:

 -open source
      -free public access software
 -high performance
      -interpreted-just in time [JIT]compiler
 -multi threading
      -many task-utilizes the same memory and other resources to execute multiple threads at the same time,
       like While typing, grammatical errors are checked along.
 -secure
       -enables us to develop virus-free, temper free system.
       Java program always runs in Java runtime environment with almost null interaction with system OS,
       hence it is more secure.
 -platform independent
      -write-once, run-anywhere language.
      - On compilation, Java program is compiled into bytecode.
       This bytecode is platform-independent
       and can be run on any machine,
       plus this bytecode format also provides security.
       Any machine with Java Runtime Environment can run Java Programs.
 -portable
      -cross-platform feature.
      -Programmers can write code in windows
       and execute the same code in Linux Operating System.
 -Object-Oriented
       -In java, everything is an object
       which has some data and behaviour.
        Java can be easily extended as it is based on Object Model.
 -Robust
      -Java makes an effort to eliminate error-prone codes by emphasizing mainly on compile-time error checking and runtime checking.
       But the main areas which Java improved were Memory Management and mishandled Exceptions by introducing automatic Garbage Collector and Exception Handling.
