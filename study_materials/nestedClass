def:
 a class within other class
adv:
 Nested classes represent a special type of relationship that is
 -it can access all the members (data members and methods) of outer class including private.
 Nested classes are used to develop more readable and maintainable code
 because it logically group classes and interfaces in one place only.
 -encapsulation
eg:
package com.learn.excercies;
class OuterClass
{
    int a=5;
    class InnerClass
    {
        int b=10;
    }
}

public class NestedClass extends OuterClass
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        OuterClass outerClass=new OuterClass();
        OuterClass.InnerClass innerClass=outerClass.new InnerClass();//near innerclass name put outerClass name
        // likewise near innerClass obj put outerclass obj
        System.out.println(outerClass.a);
        System.out.println(innerClass.b);
    }
}
